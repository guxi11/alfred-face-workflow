# Quick Face workflow for Alfred

![demo](./images/demo.gif)

## Installation

You can download them from directory `workflows`, double click the workflow then it will be imported into alfred automatically.

In the meanwhile, you can execute the shell script named `initialize.sh`, it will create some soft links into the alfred project, and all workflows can be used immediately.

```shell
./initialize.sh
```

The second way is recommended, because you can not only use the workflow, but also manage your code if you want to modify them.

### Search

Keyword `fa` : search through paths.

* `Enter`: Copy to clipboard
